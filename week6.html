<h1>Week Six: Molding and Casting</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>With fall upon us, I wanted to make some sort of fall decoration.
  I ordered some candle wicks on Amazon and got a mini pumpkin at the grocery store in order to make a pumpkin candle. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Once the candle wicks finally arrived, making the candle was fairly simple. I mixed the sand with some water and then packed it around the pumpkin.
  Next, I took out the pumpkin to make a mold cavity and stuck the wick through the hole the stem of the pumpkin made. 
  Then I heated up a bunch of wax, poured it into my mold, and let it cool. Then TA-DA, I had a pumpkin candle with a weird appendage! 
  That weird appendage was a result of the hole I used to pour the wax.
  A knife heated over a burner made quick work of it and I was left with a beautiful pumpkin candle. 

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The process for creating my pumpkin candle was simple but lengthy with a series of misadventures on the way to pumpkin candle greatness.
  <br>Misadventure #1: The wax had cooled to the form of the beaker, and when we tried to heat it up, the beaker cracked. 
       Dillon then had to spend at least ten minutes breaking the beaker off of the wax and then breaking the wax up into smaller chunks.
  <br>Misadventure #2: I thought it would be cool to have an orange pumpkin candle, so we attempted to add food coloring to wax.
      Do not try this at home. 
      Food coloring has water and hot wax+water=exploding wax. 
      Needless to say, my pumpkin candle is nice and white. 
  <br>Misadventure #3: My pumpkin just barely fit into the mold shape thing, so the sides of my pumpkin pressed up against the metal sides.
      This would not appear to be a problem, however, it meant that the hot wax had easy access to the side seam and came spilling out.
      Luckily, Dr. Smalley stoppered the leak with a gloved hand and managed to save my pumpkin from utter ruin!
  <br>Misadventure #4: Sand sticks to really hot wax. 
      Once my pumpkin was cool, I realized that the places on my pumpkin where the hottest wax first touched were covered in a thick layer of hardened waxsand.
      Fixing this problem took me, a knife, and a paintbrush about half an hour. 
      I used the knife to shave off the waxsand and the paintbrush to brush off the small particles of sand coating the pumpkin. 
      In the end, I managed to get most of the waxsand off my pumpkin and I now have a candle that looks like a pumpkin and hopefully lights like a candle.
      I wouldn't know though because I can't light a fire in my apartment.</p>
