<h1>Week Eight: Interface and Application Programming</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>This week I finished setting up and programming my LCD to count down from twenty. 
  I then hooked it up to an amazon smart plug so it could be controlled using Alexa.</p>
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<img src="countdown.jpg" alt="it's the final countdown" width="300" height="400"> 
<p>After much trial and error, Dr. Smalley and I finally figured out how to setup the LCD and program it.
  When connected to power it now reads: "WASH YOUR HANDS!" and counts down from twenty.
  
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Once we figured out what the potentiometer is/does, and followed a tutorial written for the specific LCD I was using, it was fairly simple to set up.
  It turns out that our code worked all along, but the screen wasn't showing anything because the potentiometer hadn't been turned to the right contrast.</p>
