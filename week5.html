<h1>Week Five: CNC Routing</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>I was unsure what to do in the beginnning and what the capabilities of the machines were.
  I ended up just exploring and experimenting with the machine to create shapes and write my name.</p>
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The shaper origin tool was very easy to use and had ready to use shapes that could be easily placed.
  I wrote my name and put a rectangle around it: simple but it works.
  I hung it up on my wall and I think it is a nice addition to my room.   

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Yet again I was thwarted in my effort by the indomitable chromebook... 
  There are no free online CAD tools I could use to design my own patterns for the CNC router.
  My chromebook is really thwarting my ability to be creative in Creation 101!
  We did figure out how to access all the adobe apps however, so hopefully in the future I will be able to get those up and running.</p>
<p>Other than that, things went really smoothly this week, the tools were easy to use and I made something,
  not very big, but bigger than my other projects, so I'll count that as a win :)
