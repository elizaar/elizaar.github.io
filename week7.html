<h1>Week Seven: Embedded Programing</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>This week I made an arduino blink. Yipee!</p>
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>I got an Arduino and USB from the shop and played around with it to figure out how it worked. 
  Per the usual, it took a little bit of searching to figure out how to program an Arduino from a Chromebook, but it wasn't too bad this time. 
  There is a download for Chromebooks called Chromeduino 2 that does all the things you need it to for embedded programming. 
  It was relatively easy to find and very easy to use. 
  I copied and uploaded code to make the Arduino blink from the internet. 
  The code uploaded and the audio blinked just beautifully. 
  I messed around with the blink time and all code uploaded and executed perfectly. 

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This week I also worked on my final project. 
  I attempted to code an LCD to count to twenty on Tinkercad.
  It did not work...
  However, Dr. Smalley messed around with the code a little bit more and said he found one worked. 
  Hopefully next week I will be able to set up my Arduino with an LCD and program it to count to twenty.</p>
