<h1>Week Ten: Output Devices</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<img src="motionsensor.jpg" alt="Motion sensor activating LCD" width="300" height="400">
<p>This week I wanted to set up a motion sensor to work with my LCD screen. My vision was to have motion activate my count.</p>
 
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>It was pretty easy to set this up this week.
  With only four wires needed to set up the LCD it was much easier to connect the motion sensor to the arduino.
  Then the coding was also simple to adjust from last weeks failed attempt. 
  Now, I have a motion sensor that activates a count on a LCD screen!

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>As stated above, this week went smoothly. Attaching the motion sensor was much simpler with half as many wires.</p>
