<h1>Week Eleven: Networking and Communications</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>This week I set up a Tile sticker.</p>
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<img src="tilesticker.jpg" alt="Tile Sticker" width="300" height="400">
<p>The tile sticker was super easy to set up. The app had easy and clear instructions.
  The sticker plays a nice, loud sound that should make it easy to find what is lost.
  It was very cool to see networks in action.
  The tile sticker is so tiny yet it has powerful tracking, bluetooth, and sound abilities. 
  It was cool to see the possibilities of networking soft and hardware that I would have never thought of.</h2>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I think I might give this to my mom for Christmas because she loses her keys a lot. But I also lose things a lot... I guess we'll just have to see!
  The capabilities of Tile products are amazing, but I am curious what their data tracking/collection policies are like. 
  They have access to a lot of information (just as cell phone providers are) about how and when and where people move around in their spaces.
  I am curious what their policies are about collecting this information.</p>
