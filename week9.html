<h1>Week Nine: Input Devices</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>This week I set up an PIR motion sensor that could tell my computer when motion was detected and when motion ended.</p>
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>
  <img src="motion1.jpg" alt="motion sensor" width="300" height="400"> 
<p>Setting up the motion sensor was very simple. The instructions and code on learning suite worked perfectly.
  Once practiced setting up the motion sensor I played around with how far it can detect motion (pretty dang far) 
  and changed around one of the pins so I could potetnially combine it with my LCD.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This week went very smoothly. The only note is that the motion sensor is very sensitive and not very good at detecting continuous motion.
  It easily detects when a motion begins but if there is continuous motion by it, it won't acurately tell when the motion has ended.</p>
