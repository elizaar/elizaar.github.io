<h1>Week Four: 3D Printing</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>I don't have a car which means I have to take the bus to go grocery shopping. 
  Luckily the bus stops right next to the grocery store, but it is still difficult to carry all of my bags back to my dorm. 
  I found a project on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2701924/files"> Thingiverse</a>
  that allows you to carry multiple bags at once while only holding onto one, more comfortable handle.</p>
  
 <h2>Implepentation</h2>

 <p>I was able to easily find a project on Thingiverse that I wanted to have printed. I downloaded the file for it and sent it off to the shop.
   I sent in the file on Friday evening and got the alert saying it was finished midday on Monday. 
   It looks and feels great and I can't wait to use it next time I go shopping!

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This week was interesting because I was in isolation for COVID-19 all week. Luckily it was easy to do everything remote this week.
  All in all I really had no issues or huge triumphs this week. Everything worked just as it should.  </p>
