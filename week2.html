<h1>Week Two: Laser Cutting</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>For the last year I have been collecting pins. 
  I first started by embroidering my own pins. Then when I was in London at the beginning of the year I collected a pin at a lot of the places we went. 
  When I was thinking about what to laser cut, I thought it would be fun to laser cut a pin. 
  I decided to engrave a line drawing of earth on the pin because it would represent that my pin collection comes from all over the world. 
  Or at least I hope it will at some pointâ€¦ right now I only have pins from Utah and England.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<img src="pinfile.jpg" alt="Pattern" width="500" height="500"><img src="IMG_2183.jpg" alt="pin" width="333" height="500">
<p>I created a google drawing where I uploaded the file of my earth line drawing and then added a circle around it. 
  I then saved that as an .svg file and sent it to the glowforge printer. I cut on medium particle board which is 3mm thick. 
  The glowforge took around three minutes to cut it.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>The pin worked just like I thought it would. The only problem is I think I am running out of space on my backpack!</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Using the glowforge laser cutter was straightforward and simple. 
  The only difficult part was the way I created my svg file separated into three pieces when put into the glowforge app: 
  the earth drawing, the circle, and a square background. 
  So I just had to hide the background while printing. 
Another issue when working the week was figuring out how to do a command line on my chromebook.</p>
