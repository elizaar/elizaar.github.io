<h1>Week One: Final Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>I want to create a timer that attaches to my sink that lets me know when I have washed my hands for twenty seconds. I find that when I am washing my hands I never know how long I have been washing them for. So I end up just washing them for whatever amount of time seems good, but I’m pretty sure it’s usually not a full twenty second. My goal would be to create a timer attached to the sink that counts to twenty while you are washing your hands. It will either be motion censored, so it turns on when a person approaches the sink, or attached to the water, so it starts counting when the water turns on. When the twenty seconds are up the device would play a song, give an encouraging message, or light up. Something to let you know you are done and make it more fun to use.</p>
