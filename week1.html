<h1>Week One: Final Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>I want to create a timer that attaches to my sink that lets me know when I have washed my hands for twenty seconds. I find that when I am washing my hands I never know how long I have been washing them for. So I end up just washing them for whatever amount of time seems good, but I’m pretty sure it’s usually not a full twenty second. My goal would be to create a timer attached to the sink that counts to twenty while you are washing your hands. It will either be motion censored, so it turns on when a person approaches the sink, or attached to the water, so it starts counting when the water turns on. When the twenty seconds are up the device would play a song, give an encouraging message, or light up. Something to let you know you are done and make it more fun to use.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I used GitHub to create my website. Getting started was tricky because I have never done any type of coding before. It was also more confusing to get started on a chromebook than a typical laptop because chromebooks won’t save html files. So instead of uploading an html file into GitHub, I had to create a file on the GitHub website. In the end, I think that creating a file directly in the GitHub website was probably easier than uploading a file, it was just confusing to figure out what I needed to do. 
Once I got started using html it was pretty easy and fun. W3Schools had all the info and tutorials I needed. 

Coming up with a final project idea was difficult because I don’t yet know what the scope is of the skills we will be learning, so I didn’t even know what the possibilities were. I'm sure my project will change as I learn more about the range of things I can do.
