<h1>Final Project!</h1>
<h2>Process</h2>
  
<h3>Step One: Idea</h3>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://elizaar.github.io/week1.html"> week one</a> for my original idea and sketches</p>

<h3>Step Two: LCD set up</h3>
<img src="9.jpg" alt="TinkerCAD model" width="600" height="400"><img src="4.jpg" alt="LCD #1" width="300" height="400">
<p>Connecting the LCD to my arduino took some trial and error.
I first used TinkerCAD to model the parts and find basic code.
This would have been a great place to start except that the LCD I was using had different pins than the one on TinkerCAD. 
After following a different tutorial specific to my LCD it was simple to put together, although a bit unwieldy because of the many wires and large breadboard required. 
<br>
Once all my wires were correctly hooked up, my LCD screen lit up, success!<p> 

<h3>Step Three: Coding LCD</h3>
<img src="1.jpg" alt="finally working" width="533" height="400">
<p>This was by far the most difficult step. 
Because I had no previous experience with C++, or really any coding, I did not even know where to begin. 
Dr. Smalley helped me through the coding process, and by the end, I think I was starting to understand some of the basic concepts. 
<br>
We again modeled the code in TinkerCAD. 
It took quite a while to figure out how to make the code work the way I wanted it to. 
You would think it would be fairly simple to code an LCD to count to twenty. 
If you thought that you would be wrong. 
Well, at least it wasn’t easy for us (or more accurately, for Dr. Smalley. I wasn’t much help at this part.)
<br>
Part of the problem was with TinkerCAD, or so we thought. 
The code, even the code provided by TinkerCAD was not working. 
The screen would stay blank. Remember in step two, when I reported that my LCD had successfully lit up? 
Well, just like on TinkerCAD, that is all it did. 
Both real and modeled LCDs did not display the words: “Wash your hands!” and count to twenty as they were supposed to. 
After much confusion, we finally figured out that the seemingly useless potentiometer actually controlled the contrast on the screen. 
After tuning the potentiometer, the words and count showed up beautifully on both screens.</p> 

<h3>Step Four: PIR Motion Sensor</h3>
<img src="8.jpg" alt="tinkercad model" width="533" height="400"><img src="2.jpg" alt="motion sensor" width="300" height="400"><img src="6.jpg" alt="Sketch" width="300" height="400">
<p>Setting up the motion sensor was easy. 
Setting up the motion sensor on the same Arduino as my original LCD did not work. 
There were way too many wires! Luckily the shop sells an Arduino that only uses four pins. 
Once this new Arduino was up and running it was simple to attach the motion sensor to the Arduino.
<br>
Per the usual, coding was a challenge. 
It took hours of work with both Dr. Smalley and Elias to figure out how to write code that would activate the count when the motion sensor was activated.
 Once we finally got it, the code worked pretty seamlessly from there on out</p>

<h3>Step Five: Packaging</h3>
<img src="7.jpg" alt="Sketch" width="300" height="400">
<p>Now that my internal mechanisms were working perfectly I needed to package them up nicely. 
I did this by creating a laser cut box with openings for the LCD and PIR and power cord. 
Dillon found a handy <a href=”https://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/”> site</a> for creating the .svg file for laser cut boxes.
I then modified the file in adobe illustrator to add the openings.
<br>
Getting Adobe Illustrator working took a bit of work and a long phone call with OIT because: Chromebooks. 
But now I know how to use cloud apps on my Chromebook which is super helpful. 
<br>
To create a nice finish for my box I used wood glue to attach the veneer to the top of the wood.
Luckily Jenna did this before I did so she had worked out the kinks. 
Basically, it took a lot of glue, tape, elbow grease, and a hot iron. 
It actually worked better than I thought it would. 
<br>
Dr. Smalley cut my pieces on his glowforge at home.
He cut me two boxes, one with a veneer and one without.
I think he did this because the one with the veneer got kind of burnt. 
It was actually for the best though, because I had not paid attention to where the power cord needed to go, and the non-reversible veneered piece had the opening on the wrong side. 
I ended up using the plain box which I then covered in patterned paper using mod podge. 
The finished style is different than it would have been with the veneer, but I really like how it turned out!
