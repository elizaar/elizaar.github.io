<h1>Week Three: Circuts</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>this will be my vision</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Ususally I always love my chromebook and it always is able to do everything I need it to. Well not in this class... 
  It is literally not possible to download Eagle on a chromebook. So, I was not able to practice designing the PCB, 
  Jenni had to send me all of the files she used so that I could upload them to the Ecen shop. 
  Luckily Jenna Rupper also has a chromebook so we could figure it out together.
  On the up side, I did figure out how to activate Linux command line on my chromebook! So now I can practice using a command line.
