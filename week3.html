<h1>Week Three: Circuts</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>This week I had hoped to be able to get at least the soldering done on my PCB board. However several facotors interfered with this goal.</p>
 
<h2>Implementaion</h2>

 <p>I got the files for the PCB from Jenny and sent them to the EC EN shop. So I now have a beautifully milled, but unfortunately unstuffed PCB board.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Ususally I always love my chromebook and it always is able to do everything I need it to. Well not in this class... 
  It is literally not possible to download Eagle on a chromebook. So, I was not able to practice designing the PCB, 
  Jenni had to send me all of the files she used so that I could upload them to the Ecen shop. 
  Luckily Jenna Rupper also has a chromebook so we could figure it out together.
  Unfortuantely I did not get to finish the board because my roommate tested positive for COVID-19 putting my dorm in quarantine mode.
  On the up side, I did figure out how to activate Linux command line on my chromebook! So now I can practice using a command line.
